#  Todo List App

Todo List is a **frontend web application** built using **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)**.
The app allows users to add, delete, mark as completed, and reorder todos. It also persists user data using **localStorage**, ensuring that todos are saved between sessions. The layout is fully **responsive, optimized for both desktop and mobile** devices.
